# Turntable Amplifier

MC preamplifier + RIAA filter + headphone amplifier based on TPA6120A.    

The project includes simulations of the preamplifier including RIAA filters. For the best match to the RIAA, select the filter elements from the simulations !!!
The power supply is in a separate aluminum box, allowing for arbitrary power supply selection.
